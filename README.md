This app's React frontend is built with TypeScript to play HTML5 audio with MUI-based components, fetching a list of episodes with basic info and data to play each episode. The backend is Python Django to handle REST API operations connecting to a PostgreSQL database. The live app is deployed to a Digital Ocean droplet running Linux Ubuntu. The backend also includes a multithreaded rotating API proxy to scrape the necessary data from target URLs using BeautifulSoup to parse HTML, CSS, and JavaScript data. I'm a huge This American Life fan for nearly 20 years.
